# Mood Analysis API

Due to Kodi limitations we created an API for the user to run on their local machine.


## Installation

- Download this repository as a .zip and place it in a folder on your local machine.
- Unzip the folder, MoodAnalysisAPI-main.zip
- Navigate to the directory of the unzipped folder and, make the script, requirements.sh executable and then run exec.sh.
- Once all the dependencies are properly installed, run the flask app by using the following command, 'python3 -m flask run'
- Ensure the API is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
- While the API is running you can now open QuickPicker and do the following:
    - Select 'Mood'
    - Select 'Update Movie Info'
    - Select 'Yes'

```bash
  unzip MoodAnalysisAPI-main.zip
  cd MoodAnalysisAPI
  chmod +x exec.sh
  ./exec.sh
```
